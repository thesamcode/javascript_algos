Datat structures are where we can put one or many data types inside of (we can group data types into one thing)

1. Array

The words in the array are called elements. This is an array of strings. That si what the elements are. 5 elements in the array.
var artists = ["Drake", "Weezy", "Weekend", "NIN", "Saint John"];
index            0          1       2         3       4  

.length works for characters in string
for loop repeats processa  number of times

var artists = ["Drake", "Weezy", "Weekend", "NIN", "Saint John"];

for(var i=0; i<artists.length; i++){
    console.log(artists[i])
}

console.log(artists[i].length) 
/* it will tell you how many characters in each string including spaces*/
